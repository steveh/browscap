# browscap

A simple library to parse the beloved [browscap.ini](http://browsers.garykeith.com/downloads.asp) file.
This gem was ported to Ruby by [Lukas Fittl](http://github.com/lfittl) from Python.
The original [code](http://code.google.com/p/python-browscap/source/browse/trunk/browscap.py) was written by Henning Schroeder.
Additional patches by Gilles Devaux.
Refactored by Steve Hoeksema.
